  - [Frontend](https://github.com/lucylee-412/meopets-frontend)
  - [Backend](https://github.com/lucylee-412/meopets-backend)

- [Data Analysis Project](https://github.com/Mordyfier/baseball-data-analysis) - (An introductory project done in [CISC. 3225 - Data Tools & Algorithms](http://www.brooklyn.cuny.edu/web/academics/schools/naturalsciences/departments/computers/undergraduate/course_details.php?&1=1&dsc=CISC.&crs_num=3225&div=U&mode=data) - an attempt at reproducing the results of analysis inspired by  *Moneyball*) 
- [MoviesDB](https://github.com/Mordyfier/CISC3140/tree/master/Lab%204.3) (A simple movies database GUI - a tightly coupled web app created using Postgres/Express/Node and Pugs templating engine. Hosted on Heroku [here](https://moviedb-3140.herokuapp.com/) - pagination has not yet been implemented and thus all 9.7k movies from the movielens dataset load at once)
